        <h1>Adoption and Fostering Guidelines</h1>
        <p>Please consider the amount of time that you can commit to a new furry family member. If you are ready for a life-long commitment, an adoption may be the best idea for you. If you aren't sure that you are ready for that, but have the ability to make a short term commitment, then fostering may be the next best thing. </p>
        <p>You'll also want to consider the amount of space you have, as some animals may need room to stretch their legs. Do you have a home with a nice sized, fenced in, yard? You could give one of our larger friends a new place to live. If you are living in a smaller home or apartment, please consider one of our more diminutive friends.</p>
        <p>Something else to consider would be the health needs of your new friend. Vet visits can add up, so if you have the financial means, you might be a good match for an animal that could use some extra TLC.</p>
        <br />
        <h1>Other ways to help</h1>
        <p>If you aren't able to commit to having a new furry roommate or housemate, there are other ways to help. Consider donations of food, litter, toys, or funds, as all of those assist us in helping more animals. You could also volunteer with us here, we can always use more help cleaning up after or playing with all of the animals here.</p>

            <p>This cat will warm your heart like a nice, hot cup of tea. He loves atention, and will keep your lap warm in trade for scritches behind the ear.He needs a forever home, so if you have the room, make it so. </p>

            <h2>Huey, Dewey, and Louie</h2>
            <p>These three are young and rambunctious. We'd like to get a home for all of them if we can, but even a short term foster help get them acclimated to humans.</p>

            <h2>Butterscotch</h2>
            <p>Butterscotch is a special cat who needs a lot of stimualtion. We'd recommend a home with lots of room and pet parent that has a lot of patience. He'll keep you entertained with his antics, though.</p>

            <h2>Spike</h2>
            <p>This handsome chap has been trained to fetch your laptop instead of the newspaper. He'll even bring you a towel to wipe off the drool. Well-behaved and loves evening walks. </p>

            <h2>Dobie</h2>
            <p>Just like the house elf after which he is named, this pup will dedicated to serving up fun and great memories. I wouldn't recommend giving them any socks, as they WILL eat them.</p>

            <h2>Puddles</h2>
            <p>If you are looking for a lifelong companion, this is the pup for you. They do get a bit over excited when around other animals, so make sure that they are going to be an only furry child for your family.</p>
